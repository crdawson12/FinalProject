During the month of November, the magnitude of vehicle collisions was significantly higher than any other month, with a large spike of collisions occurring later in the afternoon around 4:00-5:00pm.  An Anova was run for hour vs month, and the p-value resulting from this analysis is 0.0134. This indicated that there was a significant relationship between the hour of the day and the month of the year for the collision occurrences.

#species specific collisions per month during 2017. During the year 2017, moose collisions were the most common type of collision to occur in New Hampshire. Out of the months that had species-specific data recorded, June had the highest number of collisions occur. September and March were the months with the fewest recorded species-specific vehicle collisions. An Anova was run comparing the month with the species-specific vehicle collisions. The p-value was 1.86e-7 and the F-value was 11.95. As these values are incredibly small and large, respectively, the ANOVA analysis suggests that there is significant relationship between the month of the year and species-specific collisions in the year 2017. Using this ANOVA model, I ran tukey test to help identify any significant differences between groups of species included in the data.

#species specific collisions per month during 2015-2019. The magnitude of wildlife-vehicle collisions was highest in the month of November, followed by June. The number of collisions was lowest during the late winter/early spring months (Feb-April) as well as in August and September. An Anova was run comparing the statistical significance of the month and its effect on wildlife vehicle collisions. With the p-value being <2e-16, the analysis suggested that there was a significant relationship between the two variables, as well as provided strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The F-value, 34.97, was high and reinforced the evidence against the null hypothesis.

#species specific collisions per county during 2015-2019. Across the five-year period, the county of Hillsborough had the highest number of wildlife-vehicle collisions occur, while Coos and Sullivan counties had the lowest number of collisions. An Anova was run to analyze the relationship between county and hour of collisions. The p-value was 0.108, which did not provide strong evidence to indicate that there was a significant difference between the two variables. The F-value was also relatively small (1.604), further supporting this idea.

#species specific collisions per county during 2017 (Jan-Sept). In the year 2017, Merrimack County had highest number of moose collisions, followed by Grafton County. Merrimack had the highest number of species-specific collisions overall, with moose and deer dominating out of all four species. Carroll county had the lowest number of species-specific collisions in 2017. An Anova was run, and the analysis presented the p-value as 0.000798 and the F-value as 3.266. From this analysis, it is suggested that the county had a statistical significance on collisions occurrences.

#collisions in relation to light condition during 2015-2019. Over all five years, most wildlife-vehicle collisions occurred when it was dark and there was no streetlight. An Anova analysis indicated that this relationship was significant, as the p-value was <2e-16 and F-value was 143.5, which worked together to enforce the idea that the null hypothesis can be rejected.

After running an Anova analysis, it was indicated that there was not enough strong evidence to suggest that there was a significant relationship between road alignment and vehicle collisions.

After running an Anova analysis, it is suggested that there were significant differences between the two variables, as the p-value was 0.0031. This value, alongside the F-value of 2.408, supported the rejection of the null hypothesis.
